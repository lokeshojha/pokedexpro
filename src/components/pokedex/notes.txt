in app.js we used class components so that we can use react lifecycle method(or in 
simple language in built functions of react) ,in functional components we 
cannot use rreact  lifecycle methods

in order to display anything we need to use render() which can only be used in  a class
not in a functions


function app(){
    return(
        <div>
            <h1> hello bro </h1>
        </div>
    )
}


we have a div pokedex which is the outermost  div
    inside pokedex we have two divs pokelist and pokesearch result
            inside pokelist we have search box and 
            pokecards which display images of pokemons
